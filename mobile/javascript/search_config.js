Forfeiture of shares takes place when a shareholder fails to pay the calls made.                         Securities Premium — How dealt when shares are forfeited                          In case where Securities Premium Reserve Account has been credited and also it has been received—Securities                        Premium Reserve Account is not debited because of the restrictions on its use due to Section 52(2) of the                        Companies Act, 2013 as to utilisation.                         In case Securities Premium Reserve Account has been credited but the amount has not been received—Securities                        Premium Reserve Account is debited because, the amount has not been received and, therefore, Section 52(2)                        of the Companies Act, 2013 does not apply.                         Reissue of Forfeited Shares: Forfeited Shares can be reissued and they may be reissued at a value lower  than                        its face value. But the discount on reissue of a share cannot be more than the forfeited amount of that share                        credited to Forfeited Shares Account at the time of forfeiture.                        Regarding Reissue of Forfeited Shares, always keep in mind that:                         1.  Discount on Reissue of forfeited shares cannot exceed the forfeited amount on such shares.                         2.  If the Discount on reissue is less than the amount forfeited, the surplus (i.e., gain on reissue of shares)                           is transferred to Capital Reserve.                         3.  When only a part of the forfeited shares is reissued then the gain on reissue of such shares is transferred                           to Capital Reserve.                         4.  The forfeited amount on shares not yet reissued is shown in the Balance Sheet as an addition to the                           paid-up share capital.                         5.  When the shares are reissued at Discount, such discount is debited to Forfeited Shares Account.                         6.  If the shares are reissued at a price which is more than the nominal (face) value of the shares, the excess                           amount is credited to Securities Premium Reserve Account.                         7.  In case the forfeited shares are reissued at a price higher than the paid-up value, the excess of issue                           price over paid-up value is credited to ‘Securities Premium Reserve Account’.                       •  Private Placement of Shares: It refers to issue and allotment of shares to a selected group of persons.

Since the question is silent as to utilisation of ` 160 (excess received on application from Ramesh) between                        Share Capital and Securities Premium, it has been assumed that the entire excess of ` 160 is exclusively for                        share capital and hence credited to Forfeited Shares Account.                       4.
